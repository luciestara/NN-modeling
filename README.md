# NN-modeling

demo workflow of a NN model 

## Data
The input dat for preprocessing part (01_ImgChips.ipynb) can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12IBuZX0bF-KKsG9MLx9Mbsz65vW9GNwm?usp=share_link.
The file contains **satellite data** (imagery.tif) and **reference data** (labels.tif) needed for the training of the model.
In addition, a **QGIS style layer** (labels_style.qml) is included for better visualization of the reference data.

The satellite data consists of 3 bands, namely red, green, and near infrared.
